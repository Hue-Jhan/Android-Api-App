This application is a simple funny app based on 3 apis:

- ```Joke Api```: fetches 2 strings of a random joke, setup + punchline, [link here](https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/jokes/random)
- ```Insult Api```: fetches a string with a random insult, [link here](https://evilinsult.com/generate_insult.php?lang=en&type=json)
- ```Dog image Api```: fetches a random image of a dog, [link here](https://dog.ceo/api)

The Gui is pretty basic, its just 3 buttons and some colors, but later imma add a menu, more functionalities, api and useless stuff : )



# ðŸ’» Code

The code is based almost entirely on the APIs (except for the customizable parts), but in the future as i said before I'll add a menu n stuff.

### 1) Customization


### 2) Api implementation
